algorithm:
    1.find the first vertex with degree 0 called A
    2.add the A to the front of a queue
    while queue is not empty
    3.poll from queue into sorted and set processed to true and remove the edges orignating from A;
    4.when removing edges, update the degrees of the vertices it is connected to.
    5.if any of the vertices's degrees becomes 0, add it to the front of the queue.
